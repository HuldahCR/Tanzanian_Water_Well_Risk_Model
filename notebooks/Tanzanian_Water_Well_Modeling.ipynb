    "# 1. Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Background\n",
    "Sub-Saharan Africa faces severe water scarcity, with over 400 million people lacking access to safe drinking water (UNICEF/WHO, 2023). Tanzania, like many Sub-Saharan African countries, faces significant water scarcity challenges with only about 55-60% of its rural population having access to clean and safe water sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rural communities depend heavily on hand pumps and boreholes with over **59,000 water points** being established across the country,yet many are unreliable: studies estimate that **30–40% of rural water wells are non-functional at any given time**. This unreliability undermines the efforts of governments, NGOs, and donors who invest heavily in rural water infrastructure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The lack of reliable water access contributes to:  \n",
    "- Increased disease burden due to unsafe alternatives.  \n",
    "- Lost productivity, especially among women and children who spend hours fetching water.  \n",
    "- Strained agricultural productivity and rural economies.  \n",
    "- Incomplete achievement of UN Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation).  \n",
    "\n",
    "From prior research (World Bank, WASH studies, NGOs like WaterAid), common reasons for well failure or need for repairs include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mechanical breakdowns – pump handles, seals, rods, or cylinders wear out.\n",
    "- Poor construction quality – shallow wells collapse, improper casing, low-standard materials.\n",
    "- Water table variability – seasonal or climate-related drop in groundwater.\n",
    "- Poor community management – lack of funds, poor fee collection, or unclear ownership.\n",
    "- Environmental/geographical factors – saline water, iron contamination, or flooding.\n",
    "- Age of installation – older pumps naturally degrade without consistent maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Problem Statement\n",
    "The Government of Tanzania and development partners need to improve their ability to **predict and prevent water point failure**. Current monitoring systems are reactive and costly, often identifying broken wells only after communities are already suffering.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is:  \n",
    "- How can we **predict the functionality status of wells** (functional, needs repair, non-functional) using available installation, geospatial, and technical features?  \n",
    "- How can we detect **patterns in geospatial and operational data** that influence well longevity and reliability?  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Objectives\n",
    "The objectives of this project are to:  \n",
    "1. **Predict well functionality status** (functional / needs repair / non-functional).  \n",
    "2. **Identify geospatial and operational patterns** associated with water point failure.  \n",
    "3. **Generate explainable insights** for decision-makers such as NGOs, government institutions, and funding agencies to inform repair prioritization and new well construction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 1.4 Stakeholders\n",
    "The key stakeholders who will benefit from this analysis include:  \n",
    "- **Government of Tanzania (Ministry of Water & Rural Development):** For policy-making and allocation of resources.  \n",
    "- **Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs):** To prioritize well repairs and improve project planning.  \n",
    "- **Funding Agencies & Donors (e.g., AfDB, World Bank, UNICEF):** For evidence-based investment decisions.  \n",
    "- **Local Communities:** To ensure consistent access to clean and reliable water.  \n",
    "- **Civil Engineers & Technicians:** To identify high-risk wells and improve future designs.  \n",
    "- **Researchers & Planners:** To analyze geospatial patterns and long-term sustainability.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.5 Metrics of Success\n",
    "The project will be considered successful if:  \n",
    "- A predictive model achieves at least **70% accuracy** in correctly classifying well status on unseen data.  \n",
    "- The model provides **interpretable feature importance** (e.g., pump type, construction year, funder) that aligns with engineering and field knowledge.  \n",
    "- Key geospatial clusters of high failure rates are detected and visualized.  \n",
    "- Actionable insights are delivered, enabling:  \n",
    "  - At least **20% reduction in repair costs** by prioritizing wells likely to fail.  \n",
    "  - Improved allocation of resources for preventive maintenance.  \n"
